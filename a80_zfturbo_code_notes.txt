1) To change path of input HDF5 files and folder to store intermediate results. Change constants in a00_common_functions.py file:
SUBM_PATH = '../subm/'
HDF5_PATH = SUBM_PATH + 'ensemble_big/'
2) hdf5 files must have *_train.hdf5 and *_test.hdf5 filenames. Same prefix for each independent model.
3) Run one by one in following order (a60_* files can be run in parallel):
python a60_second_level_keras_all_models.py
python a60_second_level_lightgbm_all_models.py
python a60_second_level_xgboost_all_models.py
python a70_blenders_ensemble.py

Result will be stored in "final_ensmble_3.csv" file in SUBM_PATH folder.
